## Table of Contents
1. [2024-08-06-informal_training](https://github.com/geoepi/sandbox/blob/main/2024-08-06-informal_training/2024-08-06_informal_training_scinet_data_transfer.md): A live walk through of steps to access and move data between local machines, Atlas, Ceres, and National Agricultural Library (Juno).  Also a little R and batch submission.   
  
2. [2024-08-06-features_preprocessing](): This folder contains a tutorial on installing a few, sometimes problematic, spatial R-packages on the HPCs.  It also includes example functions to import PRISM Climate data and a few other environmental data sets directly to the HPC, extract dat from grids, etc..  This code was originally specific to a WNV analysis, but the WNV data is not in the directory.  Sections about the WNV data can be skipped over.
